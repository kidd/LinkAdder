LinkAdder

LinkAdder is a little script meant to help people write posts or webs by
automatically adding common links you that are commonly written in posts.

For example, it should help me adding the url of Barcelona.PM
(http://www.perl.cat).

The way to do it is passing a text (plain or html in near future) and LinkAdder
should ouput a modified version of the text with the links added where it
corresponds.  For the moment it's only a substitution app, but it should be
able to guess github repositories, cpan distros, and more.
